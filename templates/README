 - creator.py

|    - templates/
|
 -> fitoptions/*.cfg (if needed) [common fitoptions files]
|	(e.g. fitoptions/fitoptions_hz_0_npmts_dt1.cfg)
|
 -> species_list/*.icc (if needed) [common species lists]
|	(e.g. species_list/species_free.icc)
|
 -> fit_*/ [specific inputs and outputs for our combination]
   |	(e.g. fit_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1/)
   |
	-> logs_*/ [folder with outputs from the fitter]
   |	(e.g. logs_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1/, future log file created by the fit*.sh: logs_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1/sen_X_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1.log where X is from 0 to 10000)
   |
    -> fits_*/*.sh [folder with *.sh fitter files]
   |	(e.g. fits_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1/fit_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1_X.sh where X is from 0 to 20)
   |
    -> sbatch_*/*.sh [folder with *.sh batch submission files corr. to the fit files]
		(e.g. sbatch_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1/sbatch_hz_0_cno_free_npmts_dt1_X.sh where X is from 0 to 20)



The sbatch*.sh submission files can be launched from the sbatch folder itself, as the sbatch*.sh files call the fit via a relative path (../fits_*.sh), and the fit*.sh files call fitoptions*.cfg and species_*.icc via relative paths too (../../fitoptions/*.cfg and ../../species_list/*.icc) and have a relative path to the log files as well (../logs_*/)
